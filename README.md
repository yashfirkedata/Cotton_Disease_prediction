## Project Title: Cotton Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

### Problem Statement:
To classify cotton plant from image as diseased or not.

#### Overview
This project utilizes deep convolutional neural networks to classify images of diseased cotton plants. The goal is to accurately predict multiple cotton diseases from photographs captured with a smartphone camera.

#### The model development process involves:
- Data Preparation
- Transfer Learning
- Model Evaluation

#### Model Deployment
- Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
- Streamlit enables easy creation of interactive web apps for showcasing machine learning models.
- Users can upload images through the app to receive predictions about the health status of cotton plants.
